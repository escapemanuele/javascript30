    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    team[3] = 'Blah';

    // however what happens when we update that array?
    console.log(players, team)
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = team.slice();

    // one way

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(team)
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...team];
    

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed
    console.log(team, team4)
    team4[3] = 'dsklkd'
    console.log(team, team4)


    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const person2 = person;
    person2.age = 94;
    console.log(person, person2);
    // how do we take a copy instead?
    const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 12});
    console.log(person, cap2)
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    const cap3 = {...person};
    console.log("Obj spread", cap3)

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
